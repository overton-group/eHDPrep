\title{Calculate mutual information of a matrix of discrete values}
\usage{
discrete.mi(mat, progress.bar = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A matrix of discrete values}

\item{progress.bar}{Outputs status to terminal when set to 'text', or no
status updates are output when set to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A lower triangular matrix where element [i,j] contains the mutual
  information in bits between row i and row j of the input matrix
}
\description{
Compute mutual information between all rows of a matrix containing discrete
outcomes.
}
\details{
Note that only the lower triangle of the matrix is populated for speed, as
the result is symmetric. Takes a matrix as input.
